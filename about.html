    <p>The Bayou Lounge is inspired by the smoky jazz bars and cigar lounges of 1910s New Orleans — where velvet, brass, and blues came together in unforgettable harmony. Tucked away in the heart of Shrewsbury, we’ve recreated that rich, nostalgic atmosphere with plush seating, low golden light, and the subtle scent of oak and spice. From handcrafted cocktails to the soulful sound of live jazz, The Bayou invites you to slow down, sink in, and experience something spectacular. Every detail is designed to capture the rhythm, charm, and mystery of a bygone era — where every night tells a new story.</p>
